Donâ€™t know how to set up the file so here it is for now:
/* TESTING SELECT/DELETE/UPDATE Parser/Validator */


!ls
create table student(no i, name c20, dept c4, GPA f, comment c3);
load student("/usr/class/cs346/redbase/data/student.data");
!ls

print student;
/* TEST1: relations in selAttrs don't show up in the relations array */
select religion, ethnicity from student;


/* TEST2: relations in relations array don't show up in relcat */
select name, dept
from student, teacher;


/* TEST3: duplicate relations in relations array */
select name
from student, student;

create table teacher(no i, name c20, dept c4, reviews c3);


/* TEST4: NULL.attr not unique */
select name
from student, teacher;


/* TEST5: R.attr --> R not in relations array */
select pig.name
from student;


/* TEST 6: R.attr --> R is in relations array but not in relcat*/
select pig.name
from pig;


/* TEST 7: Trying to compare ints and floats 2attrs, 1 attr 1 value */
select teacher.no, student.no
from student, teacher
where student.no = 2.0 and teacher.no = student.gpa;


/* TEST 8: Trying to compare strings and ints 2attrs, 1 attr 1 value */
select teacher.no, student.no
from student, teacher
where student.no = "cat" and teacher.no = student.name;


/* TEST 9: Trying to compare strings and floats 2attrs, 1 attr 1 value */
select student.GPA
from student, teacher
where student.GPA = "cat" and student.GPA = teacher.name;
